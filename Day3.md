# ✅ Day 3 – Tailwind CSS Setup (CLI), Node.js, Flowbite, and Styling
## ⚙️ 1. Installed Node.js
---

## 🎯 Objective

Integrate **Tailwind CSS** with the Spring Boot project using Tailwind CLI to build a responsive and modern UI with utility-first classes.

---



**Why Node.js?**  
Tailwind CSS requires Node.js to run its build process and execute CLI commands.

**Steps:**

1. Download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).  
2. Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

✅ Node.js installed successfully.

---

## 🎨 2. Installed Tailwind CSS via CLI

**Steps:**

1. Navigate to the root of your Spring Boot project in the terminal:

```bash
npm init -y
```

2. Follow the official Tailwind CSS CLI setup guide (as it updates frequently).

✅ This created `tailwind.config.js` for customization.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Configured `tailwind.config.js`

* Customize paths, themes, and plugins in this file as needed.

---

## 🗂️ 4. Created Input and Output CSS

**Location:** `src/main/resources/static/css/`

**Files:**

* `input.css`

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

* Output file: `output.css` (generated by Tailwind CLI)

**Build Command:**

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main/resources/static/css/input.css -o ./src/main/resources/static/css/output.css --watch
```

✅ `--watch` flag automatically regenerates `output.css` on changes.

---

## 📎 5. Linked `output.css` in Thymeleaf HTML

Add the following in your HTML template (e.g., `home.html`):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" th:href="@{/css/output.css}">
```

✅ Ensures all Tailwind styles are available in the frontend.

---

## 💠 6. Flowbite Integration (Optional UI Component Library)

**Steps:**

1. Add Flowbite via CDN **after** Tailwind CSS link:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@1.7.0/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

✅ Flowbite provides pre-styled components like modals, navbars, and buttons using Tailwind CSS.
